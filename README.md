# ✨ LED Brightness Control Using PWM (Fading Effect) ✨

## 🌟 Overview
This project demonstrates how to control the brightness of an LED using **Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)** with an Arduino. The LED gradually fades in and out, creating a smooth dimming effect. Perfect for mood lighting, indicators, and fun electronics projects! 🎛️💡

## 🛠️ Components Required
- 🔹 **Arduino Board** (e.g., Uno, Mega, Nano)
- 🔹 **LED** 💡
- 🔹 **Resistor** (220Ω - 1kΩ) ⚡
- 🔹 **Jumper wires** 🔌
- 🔹 **Breadboard** (optional) 🔳

## 🔗 Circuit Diagram
1️⃣ **Connect the anode (+) of the LED** to a **PWM-enabled** digital pin on the Arduino (e.g., pin 9).  
2️⃣ **Connect the cathode (-) of the LED** to **one end** of the resistor.  
3️⃣ **Connect the other end of the resistor** to the **GND** of the Arduino.  

📌 **Note:** Make sure to use a **PWM-supported pin** (marked with `~` on most Arduino boards).

## 💻 Code
```cpp
int ledPin = 9; // PWM pin connected to LED

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  for (int brightness = 0; brightness <= 255; brightness++) {
    analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);
    delay(10);
  }
  for (int brightness = 255; brightness >= 0; brightness--) {
    analogWrite(ledPin, brightness);
    delay(10);
  }
}
```

## 🔍 Explanation
✅ The `analogWrite()` function controls the brightness by varying the **duty cycle** of the PWM signal.  
✅ The loop **gradually increases** brightness from `0` to `255`, then **decreases** back to `0` to create a fading effect.  
✅ A **small delay** is added to make the transition **smooth and visible**.  

## 🚀 Applications
- 🌙 **LED dimming** in smart lighting systems
- 📱 **Display backlight control** for screens
- 🔄 **Motor speed control** using PWM signals
- 🎶 **Audio signal generation** in sound systems

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
⚠️ **LED not fading?**
- 🔍 Check if the LED is **properly connected** with the correct polarity.
- 🛠️ Make sure you are using a **PWM-supported pin** (not all digital pins support PWM).
- ⏳ If the LED **doesn’t fade smoothly**, try **adjusting the delay value**.
